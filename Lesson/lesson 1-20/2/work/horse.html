    <h1>The Horse</h1>
    <h4><a href="tiger.html"target=_blank>למידע על הטיגר לחץ כאן</a></h4>
    <b>Horses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape predators, and possess an excellent sense of balance and a strong
     fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both
     standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults.[4] Female horses, called mares,
     carry their young for approximately 11 months and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth.
     Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four.
     They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years.</b>
