    <p style="color: aliceblue;"> What Causes a Volcano to Erupt?
        <br>
        Volcanic eruptions are among the most stunning phenomena in the natural world.
        <br>
        Volcanoes erupt because of the way heat moveדs beneath Earth’s surface.
        <br>
        Heat is conveyed from the planet’s interior to its surface largely by convection—the transfer of heat by
        movement of a heated fluid.
        <br>
        In this case, the fluid is magma — molten or partially molten rock—which is formed by the partial melting of
        Earth's mantle and crust.
        <br>
        The magma rises, and, in the last step in this heat-releasing process, erupts at the surface through volcanoes.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are three different types of eruptions:
        <br>
    <ul style="background: rgba(rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.091), green, rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.447), alpha);">
        <li>Magmatic eruptions are the most well-observed type of eruption. They involve the decompression of gas within
            magma that propels it forward.</li>
        <li>Phreatic eruptions are driven by the superheating of steam due to the close proximity of magma. This type
            exhibits no magmatic release, instead causing the granulation of existing rock.</li>
        <li>Phreatomagmatic eruptions are driven by the direct interaction of magma and water, as opposed to phreatic
            eruptions, where no fresh magma reaches the surface.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>Volcanic eruptions arise through three main mechanisms
        <li>Gas release under decompression, causing magmatic eruptions</li>
        <li>Ejection of entrained particles during steam eruptions, causing phreatic eruptions</li>
        <li>Thermal contraction from chilling on contact with water, causing phreatomagmatic eruptions</li>
    </ol>
